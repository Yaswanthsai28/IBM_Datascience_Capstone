# Coursera_Capstone

## Introduction

The main target of this project is to find similarities between the cities and clusters together so that we can find popular items in that location.

It will provide the best places to visit near you depending upon your interest.

## Data

We can use the real-time location data by using the geocoders module and Geospatial coordinates file.

The data from the previous project (Assignment) can also be used.

Foursquare data can be used.

## Methodology

The required location can be found using geocoders module.

Foursquare API can be used to obtain the nearest places of the given location.

Clustering (Un-supervised Machine Learning Algorithm) is used to group the locations with  similar properties.

The nearest locations are shown in a map for better understanding.
